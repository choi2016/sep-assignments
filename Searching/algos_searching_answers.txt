1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

-it would take 7 iterations.

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

-It would take 3 iterations.

4. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

- I would choose linear search because the collection is unsorted. If we use binary search, we would most likely never find the item we're looking for.

5. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

-I would use a binary search since the collection is sorted. Binary search would let us find the item in the least amount of time since the collection is sorted.
