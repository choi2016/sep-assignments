1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and
   manipulate the data?

   My structure allows developers to access data by using the "first", "middle", and "back" methods which gets data from 
   the array depending on their indexes. We can use the "search"
   method to find a person. Data can be added to the back of an array by using the "join" method. Any person can be removed from the data by using the "leave" method.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your
   data structure, how would you search for it?

   A for loop can be used to go through each element in an array to see if it exists.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

	Any data that has a line can be used. We can use the data structure for people buying tickets, restaurant waitlist, etc.
