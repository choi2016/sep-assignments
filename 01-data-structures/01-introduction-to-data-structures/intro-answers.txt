1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and
   manipulate the data?

   My data structure allows developers to access data by using the "at" method. Developers can manipulate the data by putting in the desired rgb colors into the insert method to enter the pixel in the matrix

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your
   data structure, how would you search for it?

   I would search for it by using a conditional statement to get the pixel's "x" and "y" values.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

	We can use datas that have rows and columns. A few including statistical, design, and table data.
